<h2>DOLCE Taxonomy</h2>
<h3>ED</h3>An endurant is wholly present (i.e. all proper parts are present) at any time that it is present.

<h3>PD</h3>A perdurant extends in time with different temporal parts.

<h3>Q</h3>Qualities are the most basic entities that can be perceived or measured; they are all qualities of other entities in which they inhere.

EXAMPLE: shape, color, size, weight, length, electrical charge.

<h3>AB</h3>
An abstract entity does not have spatial or temporal qualities and is not a quality itself.

<h3>PED</h3>
A physical endurant is an endurant with direct spatial qualities.

<h3>NPED</h3>
A non-physical endurant is an endurant without any direct spatial quality.

<h3>AS</h3>
An arbitrary sum is an endurant which is the mereological sum of any two or more endurants (physical or not). Contrarily to physical and non-physical endurants, arbitrary sums have no unity criterion.

<h3>EV</h3>
An event is a perdurant whose type is anti-cumulative, i.e., the mereological sum of two of its instances (that are not part of each other) is not an instance of this type. They are divided into (mereologically) atomic achievements and non-atomic accomplishments.

<h3>STV</h3>
A stative entity is a perdurant whose type is cumulative, i.e., the mereological sum of two of its instances is an instance of this type. They are divided into states and processes according to whether their type applies to all their temporal parts (states are homeomerous) or not (processes are not homeomerous).

<h3>TQ</h3>
A temporal quality is a quality of a perdurant. Among temporal qualities, temporal location qualities are of importance.

<h3>PQ</h3>
A physical quality is a quality of a physical endurant. Among physical qualities, spatial location qualities are of importance.

<h3>AQ</h3>
An abstract quality is a quality of a non-physical endurant.

<h3>R</h3>
A region is a part of a quality space in which qualities take ?value?, that is, in which their qualia are positioned.   

<h3>M</h3>
Amounts of matter are physical endurants with no unity. They are mereologically invariant, that is, all their parts are essential parts. Amounts of matter are referred to by mass nouns like 'gold', 'iron', 'wood', 'sand', 'meat', etc.

<h3>F</h3>
Features are physical endurants which are parasitic on some host (also a physical endurant). They exist insofar their host exists. Typical examples of features are holes, bumps, boundaries, or spots of color.

<h3>POB</h3>
The main characteristic of physical objects is that they are physical endurants with unity. However, they have no common unity criterion, since different subtypes of objects may have different unity criteria.

<h3>NPOB</h3>
Non-physical objects are non-physical endurants. They are divided into social objects and mental objects according to whether or not they are generically dependent on a community of agents. 

<h3>TR</h3>
A temporal region is a region which is part of a temporal quality space, in which the qualia of temporal qualities are positioned. Among temporal regions, time intervals are of importance.

<h3>PR</h3>
A physical region is a region which is part of a physical quality space, in which the qualia of physical qualities are positioned. Among physical regions, space regions are of importance.

<h3>AR</h3>
An abstract region is a region which is part of an abstract quality space, in which the qualia of abstract qualities are positioned. 

<h2>Mereology</h2>

<h3>P</h3>
P (for parthood) is a binary relation that is a partial ordering between abstract entities or between perdurants. It is logically synonymous to a complete extensional mereology on each of these two categories.
<h3>tP</h3>
tP (for temporary parthood) is a ternary relation between two endurants x, y and a time interval t. The intended interpretation is that the endurant x is a part of the endurant y over the time interval t.

<h2>Present</h2>

<h3>PRE</h3>
PRE is a binary relation between an endurant or a perdurant or a quality and a time interval. The interpretation is that the endurant or quality exists over the time interval or that the perdurant occurs over the time interval.

<h2>Constitution</h2>

<h3>K</h3>
K is a ternary relation between two endurants x, y and time interval t or between two perdurants x, y and time interval t. The intended interpretation is that x constitutes y over the time interval t.

<h2>Participation</h2>

<h3>PC</h3>
PC is a ternary relation between an endurant x, a perdurant y, and a time interval t. The intended interpretation is that x participates in y at time t. Every perdurant has at least an endurant that participates in it, and every endurant participates in some perdurant.

<h2>Dependence</h2>

<h3>SD</h3>
SD (for specific constant dependence) is a binary relation between two entities x, y present in time, ie, endurants, perdurants or qualities, with the intended interpretation that the existence of x specifically and constantly depends on the existence of y.

<h2>Quality and Quale</h2>

<h3>qt</h3>
qt is a binary relation between a quality and the unique entity it inheres in, which is an endurant or a perdurant or a quality. qt implies mutual specific constant dependence. 

<h3>ql</h3>
ql is a binary relation between a temporal quality and a temporal region, relating the quality to its quale.

<h3>tql</h3>
tql is a ternary relation among a non-temporal quality, a physical or abstract region and a time interval, relating the quality to its quale at a certain time.
