# molecular graph

The ontology represents atoms and bonds found in Molecular (Chemical) Graph Theory, and forms the basis for the [MOlecular Structure Ontology (MoSt)](https://github.com/gruninger/colore/blob/master/ontologies/most/) .

Hierarchy Structure
===================

- [definitions](https://github.com/gruninger/colore/blob/master/ontologies/molecular_graph/definitions/)
	- [most\_elements](https://github.com/gruninger/colore/blob/master/ontologies/molecular_graph/definitions/most_elements.clif)
	- [most\_bonds](https://github.com/gruninger/colore/blob/master/ontologies/molecular_graph/definitions/most_bonds.clif)
- [periodictable](https://github.com/gruninger/colore/blob/master/ontologies/molecular_graph/definitions/periodictable/): folder containing valency definitions for periodic elements


Verification of Theories
================================================
- This ontology has been verified with theories found in the [bipartite_incidence](https://github.com/gruninger/colore/blob/master/ontologies/bipartite_incidence/) hierarchy.
- See the [mappings](https://github.com/gruninger/colore/blob/master/ontologies/molecular_graph/mappings/) folder for translation definitions.
- See the [interprets](https://github.com/gruninger/colore/blob/master/ontologies/molecular_graph/interprets/) folder for proofs.
