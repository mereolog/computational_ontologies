<h2> PSL Modules </h2>
<h3>(activity a) </h3>
The informal semantics for activity is :
<br>
(activity a) is TRUE in an interpretation of TUpper if and only if a is a member of the class of activities in the universe of discourse of the interpretation.

<h3>(activity_occurrence occ) </h3>
The informal semantics for activity_occurrence is :
<br>
(activity_occurrence occ) is TRUE in an interpretation of TUpper if and only if occ is a member of the class of activity occurrences in the universe of discourse of the interpretation. An activity occurrence is associated with a unique activity and begins and ends at specific points in time. 
NOTE  An activity occurrence is not an instance of an activity. Although there may exist activities that have no activity occurrence, all activity occurrences must be associated with an activity

<h3>(object x) </h3>
The informal semantics for object is :
<br>
(object x) is TRUE in an interpretation of TUpper if and only if x is a member of the class of objects in the universe of discourse of the interpretation. An object is anything that is not a timepoint, nor an activity nor an activity-occurrence
<br>
Intuitively, an object is a concrete or abstract thing that can participate in an activity. Objects can come into existence (be created) and go out of existence (be "used up" as a resource) at certain points in time. In such cases, an object has a begin and an end point. In some contexts it may be useful to consider some ordinary objects as having no such points either.

<h3>(timepoint t) </h3>
The informal semantics for timepoint is :
<br>
(timepoint t) is TRUE in an interpretation of TUpper if and only if t is a member of the class of timepoints in the universe of discourse of the interpretation.Timepoints form a linear ordering.

(= t  inf-) is TRUE in an interpretation of TUpper if and only if t is the unique timepoint that is before all other timepoints in the linear ordering over timepoints in the universe of discourse of the interpretation.

<h3>inf+</h3>
The informal semantics for inf+ is :
<br>
(= t  inf+) is TRUE in an interpretation of TUpper if and only if t is the unique timepoint that is after all other timepoints in the linear ordering over timepoints in the universe of discourse of the interpretation.

<br>
The informal semantics for occurrence_of is :
(occurrence_of occ a) is TRUE in an interpretation of TUpper if and only if occ is a particular occurrence of the activity a. occurrence_of is the basic relation between activities and activity occurrences. Every activity occurrence is associated with a unique activity. An activity may have no occurrences or multiple occurrences.

<h3>(participates_in x a t) </h3>
The informal semantics for participates_in is :
<br>
(participates_in x a t) is TRUE in an interpretation of TUpper if and only if x plays some role that is not pre-specified in an occurrence of the activity a at the timepoint t in the interpretation. An object can participate in an activity only at those timepoints at which both the object exists and the activity is occurring

<h3>(beginof x) </h3>
The informal semantics for beginof is :
<br>
The domain of the beginof function is the set of activity occurrences and objects.
If x is an activity occurence in the universe of discourse of an interpretation of TUpper, then (beginof x) has the value t if and only if t is the timepoint at which the activity occurrence x begins.
<br>
EXAMPLE  (= 10 (beginof  milling_occurrence)) where milling_occurrence begins at timepoint 10.
<br>
If x is an object in the universe of discourse of an interpretation of TUpper, then (beginof x) has the value x if and only if t is the timepoint at which the object x becomes possible to participate in an activity.
<br>
EXAMPLE  (= 15 (beginof  screw)) where the object screw can participate in an activity at timepoint 15.

<h3>(endof x) </h3>
The informal semantics for endof is :
<br>
The domain of the endof function is the set of activity occurrences and objects.
If x is an activity occurrence in the universe of discourse of an interpretation of TUpper, then (endofx) has the value x if and only if t is the timepoint at which the activity occurrence x ends.
<br>
EXAMPLE  (= 25 (endof  milling_occurrence)) where milling_occurrence ends at timepoint 25.
<br>
If x is an object in the universe of discourse of an interpretation of TUpper, then (endofx) has the value x if and only if t is the timepoint at which the object x becomes no longer possible to participate in an activity.
<br>
EXAMPLE  (= 30 (endof  screw)) where screw can no longer participate in an activity at timepoint 30.
